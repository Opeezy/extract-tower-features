# extract-tower-features
 A tool for extracting tower planimetrics on LiDAR

Currently in this project, I am able to load in a data set of LiDAR points and view them using a mpl plot as well as a 3D viewer using pptk. Also, the program can draw polygons around individual features and plot them to the mpl graph using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The polygons are more of a visual representation of what the DBSCAN function is doing given the settings provided in the GUI. Right now I am trying to solve the problem of locating the individual tops of towers given that all of the towers are sorted out neatly.
